ppm(5)                    FILE FORMATS                     ppm(5)



NAME
     ppm - portable pixmap file format

DESCRIPTION
     The portable pixmap format is a  lowest  common  denominator
     color image file format.  The definition is as follows:

     - A "magic number" for identifying the  file  type.   A  ppm
       file's magic number is the two characters "P3".

     - Whitespace (blanks, TABs, CRs, LFs).

     - A width, formatted as ASCII characters in decimal.

     - Whitespace.

     - A height, again in ASCII decimal.

     - Whitespace.

     - The maximum color-component value, again in ASCII decimal.

     - Whitespace.

     - Width * height pixels, each  three  ASCII  decimal  values
       between 0 and the specified maximum value, starting at the
       top-left  corner  of  the  pixmap,  proceeding  in  normal
       English  reading  order.   The three values for each pixel
       represent red, green, and blue, respectively; a value of 0
       means  that color is off, and the maximum value means that
       color is maxxed out.

     - Characters from a "#" to the next end-of-line are  ignored
       (comments).

     - No line should be longer than 70 characters.

     Here is an example of a small pixmap in this format:
     P3
     # feep.ppm
     4 4
     15
      0  0  0    0  0  0    0  0  0   15  0 15
      0  0  0    0 15  7    0  0  0    0  0  0
      0  0  0    0  0  0    0 15  7    0  0  0
     15  0 15    0  0  0    0  0  0    0  0  0
